Assuming you already have some basic JavaScript knowledge, we recommend going trough the [Javascript, the React parts](https://reacttraining.com/blog/javascript-the-react-parts/) training to get you up to speed with a modern JavaScript syntax. It is also a great resource if to freshen up your mind if you haven't worked in javascript for sometime.

If you are not yet very comfortable with JavaScript do not worry. We also have something for you. Free Code Camp has a great [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/) tutorial where you can get started. We recommend the topics __Basic JS__, __ES6__ and __Functional Programming__.
